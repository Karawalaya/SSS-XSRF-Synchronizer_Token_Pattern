 * This LogoutController is the Servlet designed to handle the logging out of the user.

 * This controller removes session attribute 'sessionUserName', saved by the LoginController - 
 * to maintain the user's session across multiple front end pages - and invalidates and removes the session itself.
 * Also, when the user logs out, the session cookie saved at the client browser is also destroyed by overwriting it to 
 * expire as soon as it is set again.
 * 
 * At the end of the get function the user is directed to the login.jsp.
