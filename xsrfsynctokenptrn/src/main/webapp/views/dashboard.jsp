<!--
This is the Dashboard of the logged in customer.
From here the user can navigate to different services provided by the web application.
For simplicity purposes, the given three links, are directed to money transference services only.

From the given three links, 
the first link  directs the user to the legitimate transference form where depending on whether the
correct details are inputed by the legitimate user, the service will prevail and transfer the amount.

The second link directs the user to an illegitimate transference form where it is the exact replication of the legitimate form,
fabricated by an attacker who is trying to get the user to execute a request to the server in order to transfer money, 
unbeknown to the user. (This is not feasible, b/c the attacker then has to fill and submit the form always)

The third link directs the user to a page where it has a post which appeals to the user. When the user clicks the picture hoping
that he/she will receive a gift by doing so, a hidden form, which contains only the relevant fields and operators of the 
original form, is submitted to the server from the legitimate user's side, on behalf of the illegitimate attacker.
