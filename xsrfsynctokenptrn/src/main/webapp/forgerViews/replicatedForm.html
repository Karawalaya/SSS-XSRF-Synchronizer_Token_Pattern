<!--
This is the first demonstration of the illegitimate attacker's form submissions.

Here contains the form which is exactly the same as the page which contains
the legitimate user's transference form. To submit this, still the legitimate user must fill it and submit.

But it is unlikely for an educated user to trust a page, that was erected from another site while visiting it,
which looks exactly like the money transference form page provided by the bank. (Though it can only be via an email, 
which provides a link to which opens the page. But for a XSRF attack to be carried out successfully, the user must also logged 
in to the bank.)
