This is the second demonstration of the illegitimate attacker's form submissions.

Here contains the form which only contains the relevant fields and operators to carry out the attack.
They are: the action of the form - to where it is submitted to -, the method the form is submitted,
and the parameters with hard coded values.

But it is more likely to happen. The user, while logged in the banking site, can open another tab to browse the Internet.
While doing so, he/she may come across a site where is says the user has won something and to receive the gift he/she must
click on the image given (it can be a link, button etc.). This is social engineering.
